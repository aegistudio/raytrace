// A plane is rooted at (0, 0, 0) and defined by two eigen vectors.
// Please notice the eigen vectors should never be parallel in order
// to define a valid plane.

// The normal is calculated from the eigen vectors. And the w component of
// the UV coordinate should positive when the incoming vector is at
// different direction of the normal while is negative when the incoming
// vector is the same.
